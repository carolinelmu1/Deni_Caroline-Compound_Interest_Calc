Project: Compound Interest Calculator

Creators: Caroline Ellis and Denali Tonn

Link to app: https://wyijge.csb.app/

Description: This app utilizes Javascript, CSS, and HTML to display a functioning, user friendly compound interest calculator. The sassy money images, text, input fields, link to the source code, and imported fonts are all handled in HTML. These are then manipulated to look as beautiful as they do using CSS, where we defined colors, fonts, padding, margins, and more. This is also where we coded our title to grow in scale when touched with the mouse as well as allow the money to spin when touched with the mouse using transitions and transformations. Lastly, javascript is where the computation happens, as the user inputs their principal, interest rate, times compounded per year, and total number of years, allowing the app to use these to calculate the amount of money you earned and the total amount.
